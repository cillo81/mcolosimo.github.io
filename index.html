About me

I am Massimo Colosimo and I am an IT Manager at the IT Department of the Ministry of Economy in Italy. I have been to Oxford and London in 2011 and 2012/2013 for a 2 week course to improve my English. I have been training my English on this platform since 2020 because I don't want to lose familiarity with the language! I usually alternate speaking sessions with comprehension sessions.
